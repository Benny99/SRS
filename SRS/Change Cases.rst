Change Cases
=========
The content of SRS is not unchanged. As time goes on, the user's needs 
may change at any time in the development process. At this time, it is
necessary to make appropriate modifications to SRS to meet the user's 
requirements, and even the direction of development will change. At this 
time, the latest documents should prevail.
